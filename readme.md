a new chrome extension called AgentAnything. The idea is the user has multiple AI chat pages open in different tabs. The user goes to one of them and clicks the AgentAnything icon to turn that tab's AI into an agent that can interact with other tabs and manage the AI's there. So, the extension will need to parse the target tab into a series of commands that the Agent tab can call to control the AI there. A prompt containing all of those commands is generated for the Agent tab so they know what's available to them. To be clear, the target tab does NOT need to be another AI. The entire page, whatever it is, should be parsed into commands so that the AI agent can interact with the page as a tool. This also means that asynchronous changes to the target page must be reported back to the agent tab. So, if a command is issued that equals typing a search term and running that search, the search results are sent back to the Agent tab. If the target tab IS another AI, the Agent tab needs to know how it responds to its prompt commands. And it'd be nice if this all happened in the background, so the user didn't have to give up control of their screen. They can still go to those tabs and see how things are being interacted with, but using other tabs in the same browser window doesn't interrupt the agent tab making use of that tool, or the target tab being made use of.
